        *"Disclaimer: Welcome to Galactic Hangman, where we take the classic Earth game and sprinkle it with cosmic chaos. Strap on your spacesuit and prepare for an interstellar ride through the alphabet!

        Please be warned: this game is not responsible for any alien abductions, cosmic revelations, or interdimensional vortexes that may occur during gameplay. We cannot be held accountable for any frustration-induced hair loss, starry-eyed daydreaming, or accidental summoning of extraterrestrial life forms.

        Remember, the laws of gravity may not apply in this whimsical universe. Should any of your guesses mysteriously float away into the void, don't fret. It's just the mischievous gravitons having a laugh.

        Our sassy AI Hangman is known to crack space-themed puns and hurl meteor-sized sass your way. Prepare for celestial snark and unexpected intergalactic humor. Don't take it personally if you encounter a sarcastic remark; AI has its own sense of humor, light years away from the human realm.

        In the unlikely event that your spacecraft malfunctions due to uncontrollable fits of laughter, please consult a qualified technician. We're sorry for any space-age giggles gone wrong.

        By engaging in this cosmic guessing game, you acknowledge that laughter is the best escape from reality and that exploring the vastness of the universe is best done with a smile. So, buckle up, pilot, and let the interstellar wordsmithing begin!

        May the force of laughter be with you, and remember: even if you lose, you're still a star in our cosmic comedy show."

        Please note that this disclaimer is intended for entertainment purposes only.
