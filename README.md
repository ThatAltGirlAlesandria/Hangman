## Description

This project is a digital version of the hangman game that is typically played on pen & paper. This is our group project for Epicodus demonstrating the javascript concepts we have learned over the course. The theme of the game is space. To play the game a secret word will be selected based on planets or other items in the galaxy. Start the game with the "Start Game" button and try to guess the word before the hangman picture is complete. Good luck fellow space travelers.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- Use "Code" button to clone this repository
- Navigate to appropriate folder on your machine and use git clone
- Navigate to top level directly and run npm install
- After installing npm, run npm run build in your terminal. This will bundle the appropriate files into index.html in the distribution folder.
- Then run the command npm run start to start the project server and view the application (use ctrl(cmd) + c to exit server in terminal)
- Open the code with the code editor of your choice.

## Troubleshooting

- If you receive errors regarding the web pack run, 'npm install webpack@4.46.0 --save-dev --save-exact'
- If you continue to have issues setting up the environment, try deleting the package-lock.json file and the node_modules folder from the project. Then rebuild the environment by running npm install again.
